/** @file 
    This file contains code that realises a queue data structure (of
    finite maximal length) that serves to exchange sensor readings
    between the interrupt service routine in s88.c and the code for
    handling the readings in the main program code, for example in
    s88_iav.c 

    \page queue_size

    We discuss here the size of the queue.
    
    We assume the queue is long enough, changed sensor readings are
    a rare event, and that serial transmission (which pops off the
    queue) is sufficiently fast, so that the queue is never at full
    capacity -- hence we assume queuing a new reading always
    succeeds. So no error catching at the line below.
    \todo calculate the margines for the serial transmission with respect to the
    maximum speed of the s88 bus!
    \todo implement the circular buffer more efficiently (ie without blocking )
