  This file implements the driver for the S88 protocol. The only
  hardware dependent part is the use of ISR() further down. I refain
  from defining this as a normal function, and make an ISR() in the
  hardware dependet source code somewhere else which then calls this
  normal reason for performance reasons.

  \pre for AVR, timer0 needs to be set up so that the ISR() is called
  with a regular frequency as done in init_s88_hardware(). 

  For S88 protocol details, \see http://www.s88-n.eu/index-en.html.
  The ISR() then calls queue_reading() each time it finds a sensor on
  the S88 bus has changed sate. The queue behind queue_reading()
  serves to transmit the sensor information to other code that reads a changed
  sensor from the queue and then processes the changes sensor state --
  in the current case this code is in s88_iav.c.

  \todo currently we implement only one chain of sensors -- instead of 3
  as in the HSI

  \page queue_size Estimating the necessary lenght of the queue
  \todo reasoning here about the chosen size of queue -- balancing max
  speed of generation of events with rate of transmission of messages
  via the uart.

  introduce state into this function.
