/** @todo
- check EINT und timer2 are enables / disabled in a time locked fashion
- check that for running EINT must occur before TIM2_int can occur again
- simplify TIM2 and TIM0 interrupt handling
- disable and enable the interrupts alternatingly, early sei() in the timer interrupt to allow early EINT0, and to really have strong time locking
*/

/*
 * The code uses interrupt INT0 to let timer2 rum for 3/4 of
 * PERIOD_1. (\see eint0_isr.S for the actual ISR)
 * whenever we get a rising edge of the DCC signal. If the timer has
 * elapsed then we sample the DCC signal again (using the timer2
 * match interrupt). 
 * If the signal is still high, then the current bit is a 0 and if it
 * has changed back to low, it is a 1, compare to [NRMA].
 * 
 * This code owes much to [XXXX] released under a GNU licence. However
 * as released on 20/12/2011 it contained a number of inaccurucies
 * etc. I reimplemented the code following the ideas there in a more
 * structured way. 
 *
 * We will use TMER2 for the timing of DCC signals as it is the timer
 * with the highedst priorty.
 * 
 * For the ATdmega328p pin PD2 doubles as INT0 -- so this is the pin we
 * are using to feed the DCC signal.
