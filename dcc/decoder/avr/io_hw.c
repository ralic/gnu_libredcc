    If we wanted the IO to run on the ISR itself, we would call tick() in the ISR.

 * If we are running with F_CPU = 16MHz, and a prescaler 1:1024, then
 * there is a timer0 overflow every 15.625 times in a ms, that is one
 * tick is 0.064ms. If we count an 8bit timer byte up, then ports are updated
 * about every 16ms. 16ms is also enough for debouncing of the button.
