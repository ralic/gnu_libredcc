/**
 * \file
 *
 * The code in this file is based on code initially published under
 * the GNU general public license 2 by Wolfgang Kufer as part of
 * OpenDCC project (see http://www.opendcc.de) in 2006. I (Andre) owe him
 * a lot for my understanding of how to decode DCC signals reliably.
 *  
 * Major changes 
 *   - removed (now unnessary) optimisations.
 *   - introduced other (unnecessary) optimisations.
 *   - restructured in what I think (incorrectly) to be a nicer
 *     structure making it easier to adapt it to other uC (eg PIC)
 *   - separated (hard-independent) DCC part from hardware dependent-part.
 *   - (too) verbose commenting
 *
 * Basic code to decode signal bits from the DCC signal and compose bits into a DCC packet.
 * The DCC packet itself to be parsed elsewhere, in \code handle_packet
