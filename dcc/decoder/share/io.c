/**
 * Should be run with interrupts disabled. Why???
 * Albeit typically it will be run on the timer interrupt (AVR) or on
 * the main thread (PIC)
 *  
 * On the PIC, both activate_output and tick_outputs will be run on
 * the main thread, and hence sequencially, and no problems are
 * expected to arrise.
 * 
 * On the AVR, tick_outputs runs on the timer0 interrupts, and
 * activate_output on the timer2 interrupt. So if none of them
 * reenables interrupts globally, that is fine then, they will run
 * sequentially. If then tick_output (on timer0) has its interrupts
 * enabled, nothing bad can happen if it is interrupted by timer2 as
 * discussed under tick_outputs. 
 * If also timer0 has its interrupts enabled, then activate_output can
 * be interrupted by timer2. We disucss here what happens then below
 * in the code.
 *
 * 
 * We are not discussing the case of multiple interrupts, or even
 * reentrant interrupting -- this should not happen, because all
 * interrupt isrs should have terminated by the time they are due
 * again, especially the timer0 isr will be called only every 16ms or
 * so. -- so unlikely to be reentering itself.
 *
 * Timer2 instead is running often and fairly long, so it should take
 * precuations that it enables the other interrupts, but not itself
 * after a cirtical phase. 
 *
 * From the discsiion of both activate_output and tick_outputs, I
 * conclude their interaction is non critical, and both could in
 * principle run with interrupts enabled -- as nothing bad can
 * happen. We will at most miss an activation of the output, but this
 * is intentional. 
 * 
 * This method might also be reentered on two different threads (eg
 * when toggle_outputs is running on timer0 and at the same time it is
 * called from timer0 interrupt, but the nothing bad habppend as
 * maximally output_timer is set to ontime twice, and perhaps ticks
 * then one 16ms tick longer... but also that is just a theoretical
 * possibility.
