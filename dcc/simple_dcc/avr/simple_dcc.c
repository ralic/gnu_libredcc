/** \file
    Emultates SPROG as far so that it can collaborate with rocrail

    For ROCRAIL we need cmds:

    running:
    - "-": Power Off
    - "+": Power On
    - "O": Send DCC packet given as a sequence of hex bytes.
    
    programming:
    - "C" -- direct mode programming -- write only
    - "V" -- obsolete (but required by NMRA) -- not planned to implement.

    extensions:

    - "M" -- direct mode programming (ie CVs are programmed direct) --
    to be implemented
